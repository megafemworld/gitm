New Git Branch
Let add some new features to our index.html page.

We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.

So we create a new branch:

Example
git branch hello-world-images
Now we created a new branch called "hello-world-images"

Let's confirm that we have created a new branch:

Example
git branch
  hello-world-images
* master
We can see the new branch with the name "hello-world-images", but the * beside master specifies that we are currently on that branch.

checkout is the command used
